# WAGMA-SGD
WAGMA-SGD is a decentralized asynchronous SGD based on wait-avoiding group model averaging. The synchronization is relaxed by making the collectives externally-triggerable, namely, namely, a collective can be initiated without requiring that all the processes enter it. It partially reduces the data within non-overlapping groups of process, improving the parallel scalability.
